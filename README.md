Dear All

This repo presents the relevant data needed to replicate our results in the academic paper: 'Electricity Network Capacity Constraint for Industrial Sites in Great Britain' by Ahmed Gailani and Peter Taylor. 

We gratefully acknowledge the support of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), for funding this study through the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC, grant ref.: EP/S029575/1)). 

1- The file 'All_demand_headroom_data_DNOs_GB_GOR.xlsx represent the headroom data for all DNOs across Great Britain in certain years (2024,2030,2035,2040,2045,2050) across three network scenarios: 'Falling Short', 'Consumer Transformation', and 'Leading The Way'. This file represents the network headroom data needed in our paper according to our own assumptions. The original sources for this data can be obtained from the relevant sites for the DNOs which are publicaly available:
